# Nike Clone (Vite + React) — Demo

This is a minimal demo of a Nike-like frontend built with Vite + React. It includes a simple Sign Up / Sign In flow implemented using `localStorage` for demonstration only (not secure for production).

Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

App pages

- `/` — Home with sample products
- `/signup` — Create a demo account (stored in `localStorage`)
- `/signin` — Sign in to existing demo account
- `/profile` — Protected profile page

Notes

- This is a frontend-only demo. For real authentication use a backend or a provider like Firebase/Auth0.
